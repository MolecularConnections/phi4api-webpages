<span class="pageheading"  >Missing entries</span>
<br /><br />
Currently only papers are included, where the affected genes are characterised on the molecular level. For successful parsing, all nominated papers need to have a valid protein ID assigned by either EMBL, Genbank (NCBI) or UniProtKB. Only in exceptional cases the molecular information is entered manually. A further requirement for inclusion of a gene into PHI-base is that a mutant organism is tested on a host.
<br /><br />
Additional missing publication entries on any pathogenic species can be logged either by an author or another scientist to our PHIbase help-desk email address.
Note: Our coverage of the pathogen effector literature is currently less advanced because we are developing an online curation portal for authors in order to capture additional information from each publication.

The PHI-base consortium welcomes suggestions for new database entries, additional detail and new functionality. Contributors will also be acknowledged either as co-authors or in the acknowledgment section of publications on PHI-base.  -->
